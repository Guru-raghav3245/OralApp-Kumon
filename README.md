This is a simple quiz app.
  But with a twist.

The questions are audio, so you will have to listen closely to answer the questions correctly.

Also at the result screen, you will be shown the questions you did correct, and the questions you did wrong with the correct answers.
  It will show the amount of time you took, with the number of questions you attended.

This is my first time working with flutter, so don't expect much!
